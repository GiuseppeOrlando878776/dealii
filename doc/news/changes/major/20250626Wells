New: Added a new class MappingP1, which is now the default linear simplex mapping
(i.e., it is the mapping returned by ReferenceCell::get_default_linear_mapping()).
This mapping is significantly more efficient than MappingFE for linear simplex
elements: e.g., Mapping::fill_fe_values() is about 6x faster in a simple load
vector benchmark.
