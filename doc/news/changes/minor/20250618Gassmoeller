Fixed: The function GridGenerator::quarter_hyper_shell would colorize
the boundary ids of the triangulation incorrectly if the created shell
was too thin. In particular the top and bottom boundary ids would
not be set. This did not matter for the bottom boundary since it is 0,
which is also the default value, but the top boundary would not be
marked correctly for these geometries. This is fixed now.
