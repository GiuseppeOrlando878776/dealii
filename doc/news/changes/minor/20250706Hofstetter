New: GridTools::extract_ordered_boundary_vertices.
The function returns a vector with all closed
boundaries of a triangulation. Each closed boundary
is represented as a vector with vertex indices and
coordinates (as a pair).
The outer boundary is ordered counter clockwise,
inner boundaries are ordered clockwise.
