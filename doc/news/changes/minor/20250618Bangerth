Augmented: deal.II provides functions deviator(), deviator_tensor(),
and Physics::Elasticity::StandardTensors::dev_P() that all relate to
the computation of the "deviator" of a tensor. These functions use a
factor of $\frac{1}{\text{dim}}$ in their definition. This factor is
unquestionably correct for `dim==3`, but for `dim==2` it depends on
whether the model represents a truly two-dimensional situation, or is
thought of as a cross-section through a three-dimensional body. This
is, in other words, a modeling assumption. The documentation of these
functions now explicitly describes these sorts of considerations.
